# Hi there 👋🏽

I’m Allan Mogusu, a software engineer from Kenya with 3 years of experience building software.
This is my little space where I post the interesting stuff I've worked on, mostly the following:

- JavaScript, its features and design patterns
- Testing JavaScript & TypeScript applications
- Back-end Development with Python(Flask and Django)
- Front-end Development with React and Vue.
- DevOps

I blog at [allanmogusu.tk](https://allanmogusu.tk) and also on [StackAbuse](https://stackabuse.com).
